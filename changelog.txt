[TASKER]
added the event "com.wmods.wppenhacer.EVENT" with the parameters "%number" and "%event" with the following events:
viewed_message: message read
deleted_message: message deleted
viewed_status: status viewed
deleted_status: deleted status
contact_online: online contact
call_received: received call

NOTE: it works even if an event option is disabled in Wa Enhancer so you can create your own custom toast
