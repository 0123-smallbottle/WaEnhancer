[WA ENHANCER]
* Fixed an error that appears when starting WhatsApp (If a bridge error occurs, activate the System Framework in lsposed for Wa Enhancer and restart the device)
* Update translations

[CLASSFINDER]
* Fixed an issue loading primitive classes (Strangely this error seems to be coming from lsposed on some devices, so I'm releasing a solution for it)

[BUBBLE COLORS]
* Fixed in Wa 2.24.15.XX
